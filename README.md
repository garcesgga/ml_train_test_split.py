# ml_train_test_split.py
This project demonstrates the first step in building a Machine Learning pipeline: splitting data into training and testing sets. Using scikit-learn, we apply the train_test_split function to divide a dataset into subsets that allow us to train models and evaluate their performance on unseen data.
