Train/Test Split is the process of dividing a dataset into separate training and testing subsets to evaluate a model’s ability to generalize to unseen data.

# ML Train/Test Split
This project demonstrates the first step in building a Machine Learning pipeline: splitting data into training and testing sets.  
By using `scikit-learn`, we apply the `train_test_split` function to divide a dataset into subsets that allow us to train models and evaluate their performance on unseen data. This ensures that our models generalize well and do not overfit to the training data.
